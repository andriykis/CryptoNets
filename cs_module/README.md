# Private ID C# Sample Application

Powered by Private IdentityÂ® - https://private.id

## Prerequisite

Sign up on the waitlist on https://private.id to obtain your apiKey.

## Provide configuration

You have to specify valid API key in the `AppModel.cs` file:

```cs
    private const String ApiKey = "";
```

Without this step you'll be able to compile code but it will not work properly.
